          <h3>Education for a child</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the pandemic, nearly 1.6 billion children were
            affected by school closures. Some didnâ€™t return to their classrooms
            for months. At the pandemic's one-year mark, 168 million children's
            schools had remained closed for almost an entire year. During those
            months, 1 in 3 schoolchildren had no access to education.
